Map
Key pair value

Implementation
----------------
HashTable     --> Thread safe version of HashMap
			  --> Null key is not allowed	
HashMap       --> unordered unsorted
			  --> Null key is allowed	
LinkedHashMap --> insertion order is maintained
			  --> Slower insertion and deletion 
			  --> Faster iteration	

TreeHashMap   --> sorted order is maintained
